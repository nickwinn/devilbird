Return Path Ansible Style Guide
===============================

This document is intended to be a superset of the [Ansible Best Practices](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html) document.

## General

* Variables should use underscores, rather than hyphens or camelCase. Use `foo_bar`, not `foo-bar` or `fooBar`
* Where possible, prefer roles over tasks or included tasks. Howeverâ€¦
* Developing new plays/playbooks might initially be done in a single monolithic playbook to more rapidly iterate. But use existing roles where possible.
* Playbooks should be as idempotent as possible.
* Prefer Ansible modules to `command` or `shell`. 

## Formatting

Use YAML continuiation syntax to break long lines.

Correct:

```
- name: setup logrotate script
  copy: >
    src=files/mongodb.logrotate
    dest=/etc/logrotate.d/mongodb
    owner=root
    group=root
    mode=0644
```

Incorrect:

```
- name: setup logrotate script
  copy: src=files/mongodb.logrotate dest=/etc/logrotate.d/mongodb owner=root group=root mode=0644
```

Use spaces when interpolating variables.

Correct:

```
{{ foo }}
```

Incorrect:

```
{{foo}}
```

## Playbooks

Playbooks that include orchestration should also have a companion playbook that
only does remediation. This allows plays to be run against existing instances.
For example: `create-and-localize-redis.yml` might have the corresponding
`localize-redis.yml` playbook that can be run against all existing redis
instances.

## Organization

### Roles

Where possible, prefer roles over included tasks. This encourages code re-use.

### Tasks

* It is not necessary name your tasks if it's clear what they do. Bear in mind this will omit a descriptor when the play is run.
